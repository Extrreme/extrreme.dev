        <p>Welcome to my website! This is a small personal project I'm developing to display various projects I am
            working on, as well as tinker with web-development when I have the time available to do so.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img class="profile-img" src="/assets/images/profile.png" alt="">
        <p>I am a 3rd year Aerospace Engineering student, specializing in Space Systems Design, within the faculty of
            Engineering and Design at <a href="https://carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a> in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
            In my free time I love to  program, which is why stuff like this website exists!</p>

        <p>To date, I've used mostly Java for any programming project I've attempted, however I'm hoping to expand this
            by learning to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the development of this website, and languages such as C++
            for further application development. While knowledge of programming isn't directly related to my field of
            study in Aerospace Engineering, I believe programming knowledge is never harmful to have. Furthermore, we are
            moving into a world where everything is digital and online I believe it will become essential for any job to
            have a basic background in programming. Additionally, there are some programming related subfields of
            Space-Systems Design such as spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) where machine vision and
            learning is used to enable spacecraft to autonomously avoid obstacles and collisions while traversing space
            which I find quite interesting.</p>
